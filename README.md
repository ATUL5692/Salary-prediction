This project predicts an employeeâ€™s salary based on years of experience using Linear Regression. It loads a dataset (Salary_Data.csv), splits it into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, trains a regression model, and predicts salaries for the test data. The results are displayed in a table and visualized with scatter plots and a regression line using Matplotlib. The project is implemented in Python with Pandas and Scikit-Learn. To run the project, install dependencies (pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn) and execute salary_prediction.py. Future improvements could include Polynomial Regression, adding more features like education level, and developing a web app for predictions.
